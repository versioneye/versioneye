#### Hey, maintainer(s) of <%= repo_fullname %>!

We at [VersionEye](https://www.versioneye.com/signup?promo_code=BOWER) are working hard to keep up the quality of the bower's registry.

We just finished our initial analysis of the quality of the Bower.io registry:

**7530** - registered packages, *224* of them doesnt exists anymore;

We analysed **7306**  existing packages and  **1070** of them don't have bower.json on the master branch ( _that's where a Bower client pulls a data_ ).

Sadly, your library `<%= repo_fullname %>` is one of them.

Can you spare **15** minutes to help us to make Bower better?


Just add a new file `bower.json` and  change attributes.

```
{
  "name": "<%= repo_fullname %>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "path/to/main.css",
  "description": "please add it",
  "license": "Eclipse",
  "ignore": [
    ".jshintrc",
    "**/*.txt"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "<dependency_name>": "<semantic_version>",
    "<dependency_name>": "<Local_folder>",
    "<dependency_name>": "<package>"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "<test-framework-name>": "<version>"
  }
}

```

Read more about bower.json [on the official spefication](http://bower.io/#defining-a-package) and nodejs [semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver#ranges) library has great examples of proper versioning.



**NB!** Please _validate_ your bower.json with _jsonlint_ before commiting your updates.

Thank you!
