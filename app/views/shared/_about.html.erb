	VersionEye is a cross-platform search engine for open source software libraries. Currently
  we track more than 325K open source libraries from <b>Java</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Python</b>,
  <b>Node.JS</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Objective-C</b>, <b>R</b> and <b>Clojure</b>. Soon we will
  add .NET, Perl and other languages.
</p>
<p>
  You can follow any of the 325K open source libraries on VersionEye and we will notify you
  as soon the next version is released. VersionEye helps you to stay up-to-date.
</p>
<p>
  In additional to the search and follow feature, VersionEye can actively monitor your
  source code and notify you about outdated dependencies in your project. Beside that it
  shows you which licenses your dependencies are using.
</p>
<p>
  VersionEye is "free software" (FLOSS). You can use it for free for your open source projects and you are always
  in control of your data. We follow the easy-in &amp; easy-out philosophy. The VersionEye project containes
  several code repositories. Some of them are open source and we plan to open source more in future.
