Continuous Updating is an agile technique to keep your software projects up-to-date. Learn more about:
Which dependencies do I use in my software project?
Which dependencies are outdated?
When should I update?
How do I ensure that my project is still running with the updated versions?
Why should I update?
What are the advantages of Continuous Updating?
And how can I automate the process?
These are some of the questions I will answer in this session.
